<p>A population receptive field (pRF) is a quantitative model of the cumulative
response of the population of cells contained within a single fMRI voxel. The
pRF model allows us to interpret and predict the responses of a voxel to
different stimuli. Such models can be designed to describe various sensory and
cognitive processes. More recently, the pRF model has also been used to map the
retinotopic organization of multiple subcortical nuclei. Popeye allows users
to fit pRFs for visual and auditory experiments and includes an API for
cross-validation of the models. </p>
