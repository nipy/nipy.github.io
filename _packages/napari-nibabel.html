<p><a href="https://napari.org/">napari</a> is a fast, interactive, multi-dimensional image viewer for Python. It's designed for browsing, annotating, and analyzing large multi-dimensional images.</p>

<p>This plugin provides napari support for neuroimaging data via NiBabel and PyDICOM.</p>

<p>Note that this project is in an early prototype stage and is missing many features.</p>
