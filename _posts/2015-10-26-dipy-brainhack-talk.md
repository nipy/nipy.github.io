Hackathons are events focused on relatively small technology-driven projects
('hacks'). Similar to a conference or a seminar, participants
in a hackathon gather in one location with the goal of sharing
knowledge: learning from each other and sharing joint work. In contrast to
traditional conferences and seminars, though, the schedule is usually not set in
advance, and is driven mostly by the activities initiated by the participants,
and depends on serendipitous intercations that arise as people team together to
pursue their hacks.

Participating in neuroscience-oriented hackathons is an excellent
way to learn more about the software that we use for data analysis. It
is also a great way to meet other scientists/hackers in your community, and an
opportunity to learn from/with them.

[Brainhack.org](http://brainhack.org) has been active in organizing hackathons
focused on data about the human brain. During the weekend of October
23-25, brainhack.org facilitated a distributed hackathon spanning several
different sites across North, Central and South America. This
["Brainhack Americas"](http://brainhack.org/americas/) event convened together
over 100 scientists in 8 different locations, to work on collaborative software
projects focused on understanding the human brain.

Apart from the work on the projects, the distributed hackathon included talks
simultatneously broadcast through google hang out on air. [Eleftherios Garyfallidis](http://garyfallidis.github.io/pages/about.html) gave a talk
focused on diffusion MRI analysis with Dipy, featuring the cutting edge of
development on Dipy. Enjoy!
